# for the second version algorithm of paintingrobot_demo, the packages are listed as follows:
1. paintingrobot_description 
2. paintingrobot_moveit_config
3. paintingrobot_plan
4. paintingrobot_control
5. paintingrobot_visualization
6. paintingrobot_navigation
7. scanned_result

# the modified tutorial is shown as follows:

1. Input scan results, which includes:
1.1. 2D map: tif and txt document, which should be similiar to the 2D map generated by 2D laser
1.2. 3D document: xyz document, which should be under 10MB and used for visualization
1.3. STL document, which is used for painting robot planning, stl document only contains target painting surface 

2. Using 2D map for mobile platform navigation,
2.1:  put 2D map into the mobile platform navigation package

3. planning process 
3.1 (execute main_global_paintingpaths_generation_part1.m) in MATLAB
3.2 execute main_global_paintingpaths_generation_part2.m in MATLAB
3.3 execute main_mobileplatform_paintingcells_generation.m in MATLAB
3.3 python painting_climbing_and_manipulator_lplanner.py in VSCODE 


4. Visualization of planning results, painting scnene, painting robot model with some painting results motion in RVIZ
roslaunch paintingrobot_visualization paintingrobotmotion_simulation.launch


5. Verification of painting robot motion state  
5.1 roslaunch paintingrobot_control usb_port_search.launch, see if usb ports are ok or not
5.2 roslaunch paintingrobot_control paintingrobot_rosdriver.launch, see if paintingrobot ros drivers are ok or not
5.3 roslaunch paintingrobot_control paintingrobot_test.launch
--check the contained python document: "paintingrobot_motion_test.py"

6. Triggerring the motion of painting robot
6.1 roslaunch paintingrobot_control coverage_painting_demo_farubim.launch
6.3 roslaunch paintingrobot_visualization paintingrobotmotion_visualizaiton.launch


## the modification of the whole paintingrobotdemo_v2 is shown as follows:
1. the urdf model should be modified, which means that the rod model length should be shorten: not necessary
2. the relationship between manipulatorbase-and-wall distance and painting cell width should be computed out: writing part 
3. the rodclimbingandmanipulator_tspplanning.py and motion visualization.py should be added with the planning limit of rod climbing distance
4. the whole package should be test in real robot
